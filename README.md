# Vaxer: Vaccine Management System
In the dawn of the global pandemic outbreak, our administration authorities and healthcare officials have encountered a situation where vaccines are to be provided to thousands of people every day. In response to this situation, we planned to develop an application that offers a hand of help to healthcare officials and administration centers working relentlessly for our masses' welfare. This project is a sustainable approach to creating an application that supports planning and effective record management for Covid-19 vaccination clinics and centers to ensure maximum efficiency is generated out of minimal effort and time is saved. 

The program is designed for an effective data management system with the help of data file handling and Python-SQL connectivity. The program also involves the use of GUI to make the program convenient and intuitive to use.

Finally, every effort has been made to make this program as user-friendly as possible, from the menus and submenus, which allow users to intuitively find what they want, to the clear instructions and error messages that guide the user.
